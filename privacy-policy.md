# Privacy Policy — Mixologia
**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

Mixologia (“the App”) is developed and provided by **Kaan Bütünley** (“we”, “us”). This Privacy Policy explains what information the App processes, how it is used, and the choices you have.

If you have any questions, contact: **kaanbutunley@gmail.com**

---

## 1) Summary
- **Your personal cocktail data (e.g., custom recipes)** is intended to be stored in **your iCloud account via CloudKit** (private database) and/or locally on your device.
- The App uses **analytics** to understand feature usage (e.g., which screens are opened), without aiming to identify you by name.
- The App uses **OpenAI API** for the AI Builder feature. Your prompts are sent to OpenAI to generate responses.
- Subscriptions are processed by **Apple App Store** and managed in-app via **RevenueCat**.
- The App downloads and updates the recipe catalog and images via **Firebase** services (content delivery).

---

## 2) Information the App Processes

### A) Content you create (User Recipes & related data)
Depending on your settings and the App version, the App may process:
- Custom recipes you create (name, ingredients, steps, notes)
- Optional photos you attach to your recipes
- Favorites, pantry selections, tools, substitutions, shopping list items, and app preferences

**Storage**
- Primary goal: store your custom recipe data in **iCloud/CloudKit (private database)**, tied to your Apple ID.
- Some data may also be stored **locally on-device** (e.g., UserDefaults / local files) for performance and offline use.

### B) Usage & analytics data
The App uses analytics to understand how features are used, such as:
- Screen views (which screen is opened)
- Feature interactions (e.g., tapping specific buttons, using search)
- Basic device/app info (e.g., app version, OS version)

We use this to improve stability and product decisions. We do not aim to collect your name or the contents of your private recipes for analytics.

### C) Subscription & purchase data
Subscriptions are purchased through the **Apple App Store**. We may process:
- Subscription status (active/expired)
- Entitlement state needed to unlock premium features

Payments are handled by Apple. We do not receive your full payment details.

### D) AI Builder (OpenAI API)
When you use the AI Builder feature:
- The text you enter (and any recipe context you choose to include) is sent to **OpenAI** to generate a response.
- We do not intentionally include your real-world identity in these requests.

**Important:** Please avoid entering sensitive personal information into the AI Builder.

### E) Remote recipe catalog content (Firebase)
To allow adding new recipes/images without updating the app, the App may fetch catalog content from Firebase services (e.g., database/storage/remote config). This is primarily **content delivery**, not your private custom recipes.

---

## 3) Third-Party Services
The App may use the following service providers:
- **Apple** (App Store purchases, TestFlight, iCloud/CloudKit)
- **Google Firebase** (analytics and remote content delivery)
- **RevenueCat** (subscription entitlement management)
- **OpenAI** (AI Builder request processing)

Each provider may process certain technical data (e.g., IP address, device identifiers, timestamps) as part of delivering their services. Their processing is governed by their own policies.

---

## 4) How We Use Information
We use processed information to:
- Provide core app functionality (saving your recipes and preferences)
- Sync your data across your Apple devices (via iCloud/CloudKit where enabled)
- Improve the App (analytics, performance, bug fixes)
- Provide AI Builder responses (OpenAI API)
- Manage premium access (RevenueCat + Apple)

We do not sell your personal information.

---

## 5) Data Retention
- **iCloud/CloudKit data** is retained until you delete it (or disable iCloud for the App).
- **Local on-device data** is retained until you delete it in-app or uninstall the App.
- **Analytics data** may be retained according to the analytics provider’s retention settings.

---

## 6) Your Choices & Deletion
The App includes options to delete user data:
- Clear local app data (preferences, favorites, pantry, swaps, etc.)
- Delete your custom recipes data (and associated records) where available

You can also:
- Disable iCloud for the App in iOS Settings (if you do not want CloudKit sync)
- Uninstall the App to remove local data

If you need help with deletion requests, email: **kaanbutunley@gmail.com**

---

## 7) International Transfers
Service providers may process data in countries other than yours (e.g., United States). We use reputable providers and rely on their security and compliance measures.

---

## 8) Security
We use standard security practices and trusted providers. No system is 100% secure, but we work to protect the information the App processes.

---

## 9) Children
The App is not intended for children. If required by your region, you must meet the minimum legal age to access alcohol-related content.

---

## 10) Changes to this Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date will reflect the latest version.
